# MB-stuff
This is for the Merit Badge analysis work in the post 2024 Camp Hi-Sierra season.
To run the code, ensure you've downloaded R studio, the CSV and Excel files (Class_Completion and Master CHS 2024 MB schedule) should be in your working directory. 
The packages needed are readxl and writexl, so if need be write "install.packages("readxl")" and "install.packages("writexl").
Everything else should run smoothly. 
mb_stuff.xlsx is the output. It's the original file with information on class caps and potential attendees.
